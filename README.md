Introduction
Mobile automation has become an essential part of the software development life cycle as the number of mobile applications continues to grow rapidly. Appium, with its cross-platform compatibility and support for multiple programming languages, is a popular choice for automating mobile app testing.

This project provides a practical learning experience in mobile automation using Appium. It covers the basic setup, installation, and usage of Appium, as well as demonstrates how to write test scripts for mobile applications on different platforms (Android and iOS).

Features
Setup and installation guide for Appium
Sample test scripts for Android and iOS applications
Demonstrations of various Appium features, such as finding elements, interacting with UI, performing actions, and handling device-specific scenarios
Integration with popular testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, TestNG) for better test management and reporting
Best practices for writing reliable and maintainable mobile automation scripts
Troubleshooting tips and common challenges in mobile automation
